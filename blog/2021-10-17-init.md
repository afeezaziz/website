Welcome to this blog. This blog is created with [**Docusaurus 2**](https://docusaurus.io/). Thank you to the team. The purpose of this blog is to document my thinking in startups, crypto, and tech in general.

<!--truncate-->

## Who am I ?

I am Afeez Aziz, co-founder and CEO of Crypto Launchpad, a startup that's mission is to bring at least a billion user in the next three years to participate in Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and enjoy unprecented economic growth in more equal terms.

## What is the purpose of this blog ?

I will start to write on daily basis! The idea is that is to make my thinking clearer and be more responsible to my own commitments!
